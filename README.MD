# Tic-Tac-Toe

The famous game we all played back in the day. It was built as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, with a mobile-first approach. The goal with this project was to use ES5 modules, IIFEs and Factories altogether.
Taking into account that this was my first attempt at it, the code will most likely be refactored down the road, to be shorter, cleaner and more concise.
